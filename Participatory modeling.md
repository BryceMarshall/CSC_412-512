Participatory modeling according to [Barbara Quimby et. al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1525822X221076986#con1)is a research methodology used to model complex systems. 

In contrast to traditional modeling, where researchers observe and construct explanatory models of systems, participatory modeling prioritizes stakeholder and community knowledge.
This results in mutually understood models that have higher internal validity and more credibility with local stakeholders.
