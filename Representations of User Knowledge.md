Representations of User Knowledge

There are three categories of representation (of increasing complexity) which describe what a user knows about a system: Simple sequences, knowledge of methods, and mental models:

- [[Simple Sequences]]: At this level of representation, the user does not have any knowledge of the design of the system or how the system works.

- [[Knowledge of Methods]]: At this level of representation, the user does more than memorize a simple sequence to complete a task. The user knows various ways to complete tasks.

- Mental Model: At this level of representation, the user has a sufficient understanding of how the system works to be able to construct a conceptual structure of the system based on their understanding. With this “mental model”, the user can mentally “run” inputs to the model and produce outputs to decide on system actions to complete a task. 
	- A user’s mental model can be further [[Mental Model Categories|categorized]] into varying levels of representation.
