“Mental model is the dominant factor that determines the properties of usability” [quote from this paper](https://personales.upv.es/thinkmind/dl/conferences/achi/achi_2014/achi_2014_3_40_20183.pdf)

- The contents of people’s knowledge (theories of system functionality or general beliefs of a similar domain) can explain users’ behavior
- A user’s mental model of a (software) system may depend on their expertise / sophistication (e.g. a programmer v.s non programmer). A user may also have multiple mental models at different levels of abstraction and different representations for how much they know about the system **(link Representations of User Knowledge)** (e.g. a person who designed part of a system then becomes a user of the whole system)

Mental Model Research in HCI

- HCI mental model research focuses on the the contents of a user’s knowledge of a system **(link Mental Model Studies)**
- Identifying how users acquire knowledge from a system, what a user should know, and how these affect learning and performance is important for designing systems **(link Applying Mental Models to Design)** which are easy to use and learn
- There is also research in [[Shared Mental Models]]


- Users who hold increasingly complex and richer mental models (link Representation) of systems are less prone to forgetting and can interact with a system in a more flexible and efficient way ([Young, 1983 ](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315802725-4/surrogates-mappings-two-kinds-conceptual-models-interactive-devices-richard-young](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315802725-4/surrogates-mappings-two-kinds-conceptual-models-interactive-devices-richard-young)))
- Teaching users a system based on a model of a system (link **applying mental models**) leads to quicker learning, more accurate understanding, and retained knowledge when compared to users who learned a system based on repeatedly memorizing instruction input and outputs ([Kieras and Bovair 1984](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/24767)) 
- User Interfaces are intuitive when users can unconsciously apply their prior knowledge (link **Mental Model**) to effectively interact (link **Measuring** **Mental Models**) with the system through the interface.
