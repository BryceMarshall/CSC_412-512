Perceptual impairments are disabilities in perceptual organs such as visual loss and colour blindness. In the simulation of the [[Accessibility|paper]], the perception model simulates the visual perception of interface objects. It is based on the theories of visual attention. Based on the definition of perceptual impairments, visual perceptual impairment user (Blinds) interface mental model design methodologies have been observed in this tab.

# Mental model of blind users to assist designers in system development

[This paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561350) summarizes existing mental model of the blind population and advance the existing model.
- Measuring mental model can be found [[Mental Model Measurement Methods|here]]
- Understanding the mental model of blind users has been challenging.
- Existing mental models for the blind are configured by Kurniawan and Sutcliffe. In the study by Kurniawan et al, blind people have 3 strategies in dealing with a new environment.
	- Structural mental model: one or two-dimensional array of icons of applications
	- Functional mental model: created when each application in computers were associated with application (e.g. CTRL + M + W = Microsoft Words).
	- Hybrid mental model: Combination of above two models.

- For the blind people there are 3 stages in the mental model of system interaction
	- Exploration: explore desktop, explore application, discover new features…
	- Task-action: plan interaction, execute, change strategy…
	- Configuration: configure/use
