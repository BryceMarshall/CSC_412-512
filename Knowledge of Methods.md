- User have a mental mapping between task goals or subgoals and chunks of different actions (e.g. programming languages: design an algorithm -> need to do a task repeatedly -> for loops, while loops, recursion)
- Behavior models of a user holding knowledge of methods representation of a system includes dividing a goal into appropriately small subgoals for which different possible sequences of system actions can satisfy ([GOMS Model by Card et al.](https://kharms.infosci.cornell.edu/downloads/cse-556a/goms-mirror.html)). Then the user can select a method which best fits the task. Mental Model CategoriesThe mental model that a user has for a system can be described more accurately by the following classifications classifications: surrogates, metaphors, glass boxes, and networks ([Caroll and Olsen, 1987](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19890068859/downloads/19890068859.pdf))
