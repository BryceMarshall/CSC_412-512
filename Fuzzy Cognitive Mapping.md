Based on fuzzy knowledge combination \[[Kosko, 1986](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/int.4550010405)\], fuzzy cognitive mapping defines relationships between components of a system.

While relationships can indicate a "positive" or "negative" influence, they can also be assigned a quantitative degree of influence existing between the components ("high", "medium" or "low").

This allows modelers to represent systems containing lots of uncertainty and to examine perceptions of environmental or social problems \[[1](https://www.mentalmodeler.com/#download)\].
