## Surrogates 

[[User Models|User’s mental model]] accurately imitates the system behavior but without reasons for why outputs are generated. Surrogates are very difficult to construct and people may not ever construct surrogate mental models 

## Metaphors

User’s mental model of a system is an accurate or correlated comparison to a different system that the user knows a priori. The reasoning may be metaphorically accurate or could become persistent causes of error. Metaphors are easy to learn and construct and provide explanations, but could be very inaccurate.

## Glass box

User’s mental model accurately imitates the system behavior but the reasons are drawn based on various metaphors.

The user’s mental model of the system consists of the states that the system could be in and the actions that the user can take to change system states. However, the user may not have reasons for exactly why actions lead to certain states.
