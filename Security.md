# Mental models and Cyber Security
    
Mental models play an important role in the effectiveness of cybersecurity. This primarily happens when one's mental model of how a system works contradicts with the reality of that system. This can increase the chances of cyberattacks, like scams, because one does not know how to identify key markings of a scammer, how to identify a dangerous site, or the common methods that scammers use to attack. 

When there is a contradiction between reality and one's mental model, it generally comes in one of 2 forms. 
1. A [[Type 1 contradiction]] is when someone uses [[Abstraction]] to oversimplify the reality of a very complicated system. 
2. A [[Type 2 contradiction]] is when one's mental model is completely different from the reality one is attempting to understand.
