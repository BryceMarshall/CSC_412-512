- _[[Participatory modeling|Participatory design]]:_ 

Engaging users directly in the design process allows designers to observe and understand users’ thought processes and expectations. By involving users in sketching and building prototypes, designers can gain insights into others mental models and work accordingly.

- Structures interviews and questionnaires: 

Conducting structured interviews and distributing? (find a better way to say this) questionnaires can elicit detailed information about users’ perceptions and understanding of systems. This approach helps in quantifying aspects of mental models and identifying common patterns among users.

- Analysis of user interactions:

Observing how users interact with a system can reveal discrepancies between their mental models and the actual system design. Analyzing these interactions helps in identifying areas where users face difficulties, indicating a mismatch between their expectations and the system’s functionality.
