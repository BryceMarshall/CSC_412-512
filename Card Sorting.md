Card Sorting is a [research practice](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/) which asks subjects to sort a number of concepts into groups ([Wood et al., 2008](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2835577.2835578)). The subjects may be asked to choose from predefined groups or create their own.

This method is useful for eliciting mental models from test subjects. 

Criticisms of the practice suggest that card sorting may exclude important context, and that successful interpretation of the results depends on experience with analytical techniques.
