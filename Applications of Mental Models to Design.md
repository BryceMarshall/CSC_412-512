## Designing User Interfaces

- ([Loeffler et al. 2013](https://joernhurtienne.com/Publications_files/BHCI_IBIS_final.pdf))  present the IBIS method of designing intuitive interfaces (link **how mental models affect behavior**) which suggests considering and incorporating image schemas as a requirement when designing an interface. Image schemas are core structural ideas which come from everyday experience, for example up represents “more” and down represents “less” .

- ([Qian et al. 2011](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2087756.2087780?casa_token=wOwcaeicenAAAAAA:gThogt4s8sDP2anRtF17_hGTfJ4Aum2j2K0uc4j6A7Rg5kpRJsHT_tJILFzPTX6NUvwBqsnCe5-w) ) propose a design framework for designing interfaces in which metaphors (**link representations**) are constructed based on users’ mental models. Users provide a sketches for designers to access a user’s mental model of a system, then design an interface which incorporates some of the users’ important expectations with the incorporation of metaphors in the UI (e.g. using real world objects as names or navigation tools)

- Wright and Bason (1982) experimented with designing two software packages for data analysis. The first package’s interface was designed to be as similar as possible to users’ prior knowledge and what operations users wanted. The second package was designed based on how what the system designer thought should be done with the data. The second design was overwhelmingly preferred, suggesting that designing based on the user’s existing knowledge and preferences may not be better.

  

- Carroll and Carrithers (1984) designed a system interface based on the [[Mental Model Categories#Glass box|glass box model]] which taught the user to use the system by initially introducing a small set of commands and gradually introduced complicated commands, which led to [[Instructions for Mental Models|faster learning]].
