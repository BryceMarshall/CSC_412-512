Applications of Mental Models to Design

Designing User Interfaces:

- (Loeffler et al. 2013 [https://joernhurtienne.com/Publications_files/BHCI_IBIS_final.pdf](https://joernhurtienne.com/Publications_files/BHCI_IBIS_final.pdf))  present the IBIS method of designing intuitive interfaces (link **how mental models affect behavior**) which suggests considering and incorporating image schemas as a requirement when designing an interface. Image schemas are core structural ideas which come from everyday experience, for example up represents “more” and down represents “less” .

Users provide a sketches for designers to access a user’s mental model of a system, then design an interface which incorporates some of the users’ important expectations with the incorporation of metaphors in the UI (e.g. using real world objects as names or navigation tools)

- Wright and Bason (1982) experimented with designing two software packages for data analysis. The first package’s interface was designed to be as similar as possible to users’ prior knowledge and what operations users wanted. The second package was designed based on how what the system designer thought should be done with the data. The second design was overwhelmingly preferred, suggesting that designing based on the user’s existing knowledge and preferences may not be better.

  

- Carroll and Carrithers (1984) designed a system interface based on the glass box model (link Representation) which taught the user to use the system by initially introducing a small set of commands and gradually introduced complicated commands, which led to faster learning (link **Instructions for Mental Models**

Information Architecture: 

- Designing shared information environments such that the is understandable to all who use it - CAULDRON/UX paper cite laterInstructions for Mental ModelsSystem Instructions for Mental Models:

- Mental models for systems can be taught effectively by using multimedia instruction, for example by combining visuals (like animations and images), audio, and textual instructions (Mayer and Moreno, 2002 [https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-02073-014](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-02073-014)) 
- Learners can form mental models more effectively by allowing the learner to interact with the system and identify important information and operations themselves (active learning), which allows them to make their own mental connections to existing knowledge (link **mental models**) (Mayer, 1999 [https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dd.1.1.02may](https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/dd.1.1.02may))
