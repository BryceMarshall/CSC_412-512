- ([Loeffler et al. 2013](https://joernhurtienne.com/Publications_files/BHCI_IBIS_final.pdf))  present the IBIS method of designing [[Mental Models and Behaviour|intuitive interfaces]]  which suggests considering and incorporating image schemas as a requirement when designing an interface. Image schemas are core structural ideas which come from everyday experience, for example up represents “more” and down represents “less” .

Users provide a sketches for designers to access a user’s mental model of a system, then design an interface which incorporates some of the users’ important expectations with the incorporation of metaphors in the UI (e.g. using real world objects as names or navigation tools)

- Wright and Bason (1982) experimented with designing two software packages for data analysis. The first package’s interface was designed to be as similar as possible to users’ prior knowledge and what operations users wanted. The second package was designed based on how what the system designer thought should be done with the data. The second design was overwhelmingly preferred, suggesting that designing based on the user’s existing knowledge and preferences may not be better.

- Carroll and Carrithers (1984) designed a system interface based on the [[Mental Model Categories#Glass box|glass box model]] which taught the user to use the system by initially introducing a small set of commands and gradually introduced complicated commands, which led to [[Instructions for Mental Models|faster learning]].

## Design for [[Accessibility]]

Mental model of the designer and the user should match for a natural user experience.

## Design for [[Shared Mental Models|Collaboration]]

Designing UI for shared systems requires clear role management and real-time collaboration tools to support multiple users working together efficiently.

## Information Architecture

Information Architecture (IA) is the practice of structuring, organizing, and labeling information in a way that aligns with users’ mental models, ensuring that digital interfaces are intuitive and easy to navigate. Mental models represent how users expect a system to work based on prior experiences and cognitive processes. When IA aligns with users' mental models, it enhances usability, efficiency, and decision-making, allowing users to find and process information with minimal effort. Conversely, if IA and mental models do not match, it can cause confusion, increased cognitive load, and navigation difficulties.

In user experience (UX) design, IA plays a critical role in creating logical site structures, intuitive navigation menus, and accessible content layouts. Designers apply mental models to categorize information effectively, ensuring that users can predict where to find content based on familiar patterns. Methods like [[Card Sorting|card sorting]] help researchers understand how users mentally group information, allowing them to refine IA accordingly.

[Martín & Macías (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2022.2041885) developed [[CAULDRON]] - Comprehensive Analysis User-centered Learning-based Decision-making Research On Navigation – as a tool to help designers capture user models and inform information architecture. 

### [[Shared Mental Models|Collaborative Visualization Systems ]]

Collaborative Visualization Systems (CoVis) are interactive platforms that enable multiple users to work together in real-time data analysis, decision-making, and problem-solving. The idea behind these platforms is that SMM can be improved using technological development. In such environments, floor control is essential to ensure smooth collaboration, prevent conflicts, and maintain alignment among users' shared mental models.
