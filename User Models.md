User models are essential for understanding how different users form mental models when [[interacting with a UI|Representations of User Knowledge]]. A mental model represents a user's internal understanding of how a system should work, shaped by their prior experiences, expectations, and interactions with similar interfaces. Because users approach digital systems with varying levels of expertise, familiarity, and cognitive strategies, their mental models can differ significantly. For example, a novice user may expect step-by-step guidance and clear visual cues, while an expert may anticipate shortcuts and efficiency-driven navigation. 

Cultural background, [[physical differences|Accessibility]], personal preferences, and even device familiarity also influence mental models, affecting how users interpret icons, menus, and interaction flows. When a UI aligns with a user's mental model, interactions feel intuitive and predictable, reducing cognitive load and frustration. However, if a system contradicts or disrupts established mental models—such as unfamiliar gestures, unclear navigation, or unexpected behaviors—users may struggle to adapt, leading to errors and inefficiencies. By incorporating user models into UI design, developers can predict and accommodate diverse mental models, ensuring that interfaces are more intuitive, adaptable, and user-friendly for a broad audience.
