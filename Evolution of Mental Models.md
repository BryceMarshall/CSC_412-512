Mental models are internal representations that individuals construct to understand and interact with the world around them. These models have been a subject of interest across various disciplines, leading to diverse perspectives on their nature and development. ([Johnson-Laird, 2004](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203506936-10/history-mental-models-johnson-laird)) 

## Historical Perspectives of Mental models ([Thagard, 2010](http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/Thagard.brains-models.2010.pdf))

* The concept of mental models have been evolving over time
* In 19th century philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce introduced the idea of icons; laying groundwork for understanding internal representations
* In the mid 20th century psychologist Kenneth Craik proposed that the mind constructs small scale models of reality â€“ suggesting that these mental models are fundamental to reasoning and decision making
* This perspective was further developed by Philip Johnson-Laird; believed that mental models are integral to human cognition enabling individuals to simulate and reason different scenarios

As our understanding of mental models has evolved, so too have the tools and technologies that shape them. With advancements in technology, cognitive science, and human-computer interactions, the ways that [[Mental Models and Behaviour|mental models]] affect individuals is ever changing. These developments raise important questions about how mental models will continue to evolve in the future (link to future).
