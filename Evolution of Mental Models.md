Mental models are internal representations that individuals construct to understand and interact with the world around them. These models have been a subject of interest across various disciplines, leading to diverse perspectives on their nature and development.

Historical perspectives

- The concept of mental models have been evolving over time
- In 19th century philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce introduced the idea of icons; laying groundwork for understanding internal representations
- In the mid 20th century psychologist Kenneth Craik proposed that the mind constructs small scale models of reality – suggesting that these mental models are fundamental to reasoning and decision making
- ^ this perspective was further developed by Philip Johnson-Laird; believed that mental models are integral to human cognition enabling individuals to simulate and reason different scenarios

Neural Insights

- Advancements in neuroscience has provided deeper insights into how mental models are formed and represented in the brain
- Mental models consists of patterns of activation across neural populations, allowing individuals to simulate and predict various situationsPastFutureFuture research questions

- There is little research which evaluates how long, how many interactions, and what kinds of interactions it takes for a user to develop a mental model (link Mental Model) of a system which is consistent with the developer’s mental model of a system.  (Qian et al. 2011 [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2087756.2087780?casa_token=wOwcaeicenAAAAAA:gThogt4s8sDP2anRtF17_hGTfJ4Aum2j2K0uc4j6A7Rg5kpRJsHT_tJILFzPTX6NUvwBqsnCe5-w](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2087756.2087780?casa_token=wOwcaeicenAAAAAA:gThogt4s8sDP2anRtF17_hGTfJ4Aum2j2K0uc4j6A7Rg5kpRJsHT_tJILFzPTX6NUvwBqsnCe5-w) )
- To develop a mental model, are metaphors (link Representation) to a physical (real-world) object or prototype such as physical tools easier to understand than metaphors to other computer applications?
