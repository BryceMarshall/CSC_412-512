# Future of Mental Models

* There is little research which evaluates how long, how many interactions, and what kinds of interactions it takes for a user to develop a [[Mental Models and Behaviour|mental model]] of a system which is consistent with the developerâ€™s mental model of a system.  ([Qian et al. 2011](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2087756.2087780?casa_token=wOwcaeicenAAAAAA:gThogt4s8sDP2anRtF17_hGTfJ4Aum2j2K0uc4j6A7Rg5kpRJsHT_tJILFzPTX6NUvwBqsnCe5-w))

* To develop a mental model, are [[Representations of User Knowledge|metaphors]] to a physical (real-world) object or prototype such as physical tools easier to understand than metaphors to other computer applications? ([Qian et al. 2011](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2087756.2087780?casa_token=wOwcaeicenAAAAAA:gThogt4s8sDP2anRtF17_hGTfJ4Aum2j2K0uc4j6A7Rg5kpRJsHT_tJILFzPTX6NUvwBqsnCe5-w))

* [[Future of abstraction]] as technology evolves.
