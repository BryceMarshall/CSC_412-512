When user interfaces (UIs) are not designed with accessibility in mind, they can create serious security vulnerabilities for individuals with disabilities. These issues arise because security features—such as password entry, authentication systems, and privacy settings—are often designed for users with full motor, cognitive, and sensory abilities, ignoring the needs of those with impairments. Both [Sulong & Raja Yusof (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-023-01035-5) and [Biswas *et al* (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2011.565718) addressed these shortcomings, particularily for those with visual impairments. 

#### Design solutions for adaptive security

| **Problem** | **Example** | **Solution** |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Users with visual impairments rely on screen readers, voice commands, or magnification tools, but many security features (CAPTCHAs, password fields, MFA notifications) are not compatible with assistive technologies.** | A user who is blind and depends on screen readers may struggle with image-based authentication or inaccessible CAPTCHA challenges, forcing them to seek assistance and exposing private credentials. | Implement audio-based CAPTCHAs, voice-activated authentication, and screen reader-friendly verification prompts. |
| **Users with cognitive disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, ADHD, memory impairments) may struggle with complex passwords, time-sensitive logins, or multi-step verification processes. Security measures that require quick responses, pattern recognition, or precise recall may not align with their mental model.** | A user with a memory impairment may struggle to recall strong passwords or security questions, leading to frequent lockouts or unsafe behaviors like writing down passwords. | Provide password managers, biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID), and customizable security settings that reduce cognitive strain. |
| **Users with motor impairments (e.g., Parkinson’s, cerebral palsy, arthritis) may struggle with precise cursor movements, fast typing, or completing time-sensitive authentication steps. Security interfaces that assume rapid and precise input create major usability barriers.** | A user with tremors may struggle to enter a password without typos or complete a two-factor authentication (2FA) code within a short time frame, leading to account lockouts. | Support alternative input methods, such as adaptive keyboards, voice-based authentication, and longer timeframes for entering verification codes. |
