# Shared Mental Models

A Shared Mental Model refers to a common understanding among team members, enabling them to coordinate effectively, anticipate actions, and adapt to task demands. Literature general categorizes shared mental models into four types:

1. Task-Specific Knowledge – Shared understanding of specific procedures, sequences, and strategies needed to perform a task.
2. Task-Related Knowledge – General knowledge about a task’s purpose, operations, and importance, which applies to multiple tasks.
3. Knowledge of Teammates – Awareness of team members’ strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies, improving coordination.
4. Attitudes and Beliefs – Shared values and perspectives that influence team decision-making and cohesion.

[Yusoff & Salim, (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49044-7) Outlined the following key finidngs on their study of SMMs:

1. High-performing teams tend to develop more accurate and similar shared mental models, leading to better coordination.
2. Visualization systems improve shared cognition by externalizing thought processes and helping users understand each other’s actions.
3. Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) methods are valuable for evaluating how well teams develop and use shared mental models in digital environments.

### Floor Control and Its Role in Shared Mental Models

Floor control refers to the mechanism that determines who has control over interactions in a shared system, particularly in collaborative visualization technologies and multi-user interfaces. In the context of Shared Mental Models (SMMs), floor control is crucial because it regulates access, prevents conflicts, and ensures smooth coordination among users who must work together to process information and make decisions.

A well-managed floor control system helps maintain alignment between team members’ mental models, ensuring that individuals understand who is responsible for what actions, when they can contribute, and how shared resources are updated. Poorly implemented floor control can disrupt shared cognition, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in collaborative tasks. 

### Collaborative Visualization Systems 

Collaborative Visualization Systems (CoVis) are interactive platforms that enable multiple users to work together in real-time data analysis, decision-making, and problem-solving. The idea behind these platforms is that SMM can be improved using technological development. In such environments, floor control is essential to ensure smooth collaboration, prevent conflicts, and maintain alignment among users' shared mental models.
