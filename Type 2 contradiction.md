## Type 2 contradiction

A type 2 contradiction is more common to corporations with a designated security department. A type 2 contradiction occurs when either a user's mental model is more complicated than the system they are using or the user assumes the system does something that it does not. 

An example of a type 2 contradiction is when an employee opens a virus infested email on a company computer. The employee's mental model of the computer's security might involve a firewall that prevents any viruses when that might not be the case.  

Another example of a type 2 contradiction might involve a user of a video game assuming, "If I restart my game right before the final boss, the timer will reset and he will be easier to beat." when the truth is that the boss has nothing to do with the timer's settings.  In reality, the user's assumed advantage is from the player simply relaxing their thumbs for a few minutes prior to the fight.
