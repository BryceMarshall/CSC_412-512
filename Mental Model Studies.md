### Mental Model studies in HCI

- Student interactions with ATMS: Students asked questions about the functions of an ATM revealed the mental model they held for the functionality and design of the machine and what information is stored on an access card (Collins and Genter, 1987)

### Mental Model studies in Software

- Users’ understanding of browsers:  Showed that users do not have an accurate understanding of how the “back” and “forward” buttons of browsers work because they did not have a correct mental model for how search histories are saved and updated when back and forward are clicked (Cockburn and Jones, 1996)

### Mental Model studies in Interface Design

- [[Mental Model Measurement Methods|Measuring]] student mental models: Conducted an experiment utilizing a questionnaire designed to measure the “degree of formed mental model” which pertains to logical thinking and organization. This approach provided insights into the potential effectiveness of mental model measurement methods and understanding ussr cognition related to interface design ([Mori and Yamaoka, 2014](https://personales.upv.es/thinkmind/dl/conferences/achi/achi_2014/achi_2014_3_40_20183.pdf)).

- Users who hold increasingly complex and [[Mental Model Categories|richer mental models]] of systems are less prone to forgetting and can interact with a system in a more flexible and efficient way ([Young, 1983 ](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315802725-4/surrogates-mappings-two-kinds-conceptual-models-interactive-devices-richard-young](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315802725-4/surrogates-mappings-two-kinds-conceptual-models-interactive-devices-richard-young)))

- [[Instructions for Mental Models|Teaching users a system]] based on a model of a system leads to quicker learning, more accurate understanding, and retained knowledge when compared to users who learned a system based on repeatedly memorizing instruction input and outputs ([Kieras and Bovair 1984](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/24767)) 

- User Interfaces are intuitive when users can unconsciously [[Mental Models and Behaviour|apply their prior knowledge]] to effectively interact with the system through the interface. ([Mohs et al., 2006](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257700846_IUUI_-_Intuitive_use_of_user_interfaces)) 

## Mental Model studies on System Descriptions

- Measuring how initial system descriptions influence mental models and user responses (link to how mental models affect behaviour and measuring): Manipulated the participants’ mental models by providing them with either accurate or misleading information about a system’s functionality before they interacted. Concluded that initial system descriptions significantly influence mental models and user interactions. Findings highlight the importance of accurate and complete instructions when designing systems (Blömacher, Nöcker, and Huff, 2019)
