#Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of simplifying a system in order to have a more concise and easy to understand mental model. Abstraction is a natural part of language as it saves people time and energy by simplifying systems that are either common sense or simply not crucial to the conversation. 

An example of abstraction in language would be saying, "I plugged in the toaster." Without abstraction they could also say, "I took the electrical cord sticking out of my toast making appliance and gently inserted it into the matching wall outlet. At that point, the active electrons created through friction at the local hydroelectric power dam flowed in to the toast making appliance." 

##Cautionary tale about the future of abstraction#

Abstraction is a crucial part of living in a high technology world, but it does have a negative consequence to its misuse. Modern computer systems are extremely complicated and far more intricate than the average person needs to understand in order to use the technology.  Plus, companies often purposely hide how their technology works from their users. This creates a very real risk of users of a technology being unable to debug and fix a technology that is important to them. An example of this might be when a person with diabetes requires an insulin pump to survive but not knowing what to do if the device fails.
