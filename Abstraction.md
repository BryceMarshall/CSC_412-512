# Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of simplifying a system in order to have a more concise and easy to understand mental model. Abstraction is a natural part of language as it saves people time and energy by simplifying systems that are either common sense or simply not crucial to the conversation. 

An example of abstraction in language would be saying, "I plugged in the toaster." Without abstraction they could also say, "I took the electrical cord sticking out of my toast making appliance and gently inserted it into the matching wall outlet. At that point, the active electrons created through friction at the local hydroelectric power dam flowed in to the toast making appliance." 

Without sufficient education, the [[Future of abstraction]] could lead to problems.
