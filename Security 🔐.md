# Mental models and cyber security
    
Mental models play an important role in the effectiveness of cybersecurity. This primarily happens when one's mental model of how a system works contradicts with the reality of that system. This can increase the chances of cyberattacks, like scams, because one does not know how to identify key markings of a scammer, how to identify a dangerous site, or the common methods that scammers use to attack. 

When there is a contradiction between reality and one's mental model, it generally comes in one of 2 forms. 
>1. A type 1 contradiction is when someone uses [[Abstraction]] to oversimplify the reality of a very complicated system. 
>2. A type 2 contradiction is when one's mental model is completely different from the reality one is attempting to understand. 

## Type 1 contradiction

A type 1 contradiction is by far the most common and costly to the average user. A type 1 contradiction is usually caused by [[Abstraction]] because as technology gets more advanced and user friendly, the act of "Troubleshooting" becomes "it just works".

A  well-trodden example of the consequences of a type 1 contradiction is the anecdote of how scammers routinely attack the livelihood of the elderly. According to [Steven Kemp and Nieves Erades PÃ©rez](https://search.library.uvic.ca/permalink/01VIC_INST/1ohem39/cdi_pubmedcentral_primary_oai_pubmedcentral_nih_gov_10094555), the truth is that the elderly are less likely to lose money to scammers, but they are far more likely to be embarrassed by an attack. The reason that this anecdote exists is the fact that the elderly have a very poor mental model of the internet and consequently are less able to protect themselves than someone with a stronger mental model. 

## Type 2 contradiction

A type 2 contradiction is more common to corporations with a designated security department. A type 2 contradiction occurs when either a user's mental model is more complicated than the system they are using or the user assumes the system does something that it does not. 

An example of a type 2 contradiction is when an employee opens a virus infested email on a company computer. The employee's mental model of the computer's security might involve a firewall that prevents any viruses when that might not be the case.  

Another example of a type 2 contradiction might involve a user of a video game assuming, "If I restart my game right before the final boss, the timer will reset and he will be easier to beat." when the truth is that the boss has nothing to do with the timer's settings.  In reality, the user's assumed advantage is from the player simply relaxing their thumbs for a few minutes prior to the fight.
