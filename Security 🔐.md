Cautionary tale about the future of abstraction 

  

Outline

- Intro

- Mental models have a huge effect on a someone's cyber security
- Not knowing how the internet works can cause one to make unhelpful choices in terms of personal cyber security
- Computers are very complex so people tend to oversimplify a system
- The more complex the system, the greater risk 

- Consequences of mental models =/= reality

- "Finally, in terms of social factors, social isolation may make older persons easier to manipulate and may reduce their awareness of potential fraud risks on the other hand, it has been shown that fraud victimization now mainly occurs online" [1]
- "55.5% of respondents in the full weighted sample had experienced at least one form of consumer scam or fraud in the previous two years." [1]
- "fraud has been shown to have psychological effects, cause mental and physical health problems, damage a person’s reputation, and produce positive and negative behavior changes" [1]
- "As the interconnected web of digital systems managing our health, wealth, and national security continues to diversify and increase in complexity, so too does the requirement for their security and integrity. Failures of these systems can be devastating, halting healthcare services to thousands of patients" [2]

- Example "TLS warning"

- "One common example of a security issue is when users encounter an SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) 1 warning as they attempt to visit a website. TLS warnings can occur as a result of server misconfigurations, self-signed certificates, or malicious activity (Fahl et al., 2014), so there are both fairly innocuous reasons and very legitimate security reasons for a user seeing this warning." [3]
- "A prevalent approach to this topic is to assume that people understand cybersecurity through the use of particular metaphors, analogies, and mental models that are more familiar" [3]
- "users could internally model security risk as akin to a medical risk (viruses that attack the computer, etc.), or as akin to a theft risk (evil doers trying to steal money, property, or information), or as akin to a physical risk (computers that could “crash”)" [3]
- "The generic TLS warning does little to encourage or discourage these particular mental models, so users are relatively free to adopt whatever mental model they like" [3]

- Poorly/overcomplicated systems

- "Humans still contribute to the failure of complex systems. This occurs, in part, because it can be difficult to anticipate all the ways that human-automation interaction could lead to system failure This is true when successful task execution relies on the user’s mental model of system operational characteristics and actions, particularly where users have had little opportunity (through practical experience, training, or reading, among other strategies) to develop an appropriate mental model." [2]
- "As organizations roll out improved threat detection and intrusion prevention systems to bolster cybersecurity, attackers may turn to targeting humans rather than only hardware and software. " [2]
- "Norman defines a mental model as “a user’s internal representation of the function of the target system” (p. 7), which are often abstract and may be incomplete, unscientific, imprecise, or based in superstitions." [2]
