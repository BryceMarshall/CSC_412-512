# Mental Models and Behaviour

“Mental model is the dominant factor that determines the properties of usability” ([Mori and Yamaoka, 2014](https://personales.upv.es/thinkmind/dl/conferences/achi/achi_2014/achi_2014_3_40_20183.pdf))

- The contents of people’s knowledge (theories of system functionality or general beliefs of a similar domain) can explain users’ behavior
- A user’s mental model of a (software) system may depend on their expertise / sophistication (e.g. a programmer v.s non programmer). A user may also have multiple mental models at different levels of [[Abstraction|abstraction]] and different [[Representations of User Knowledge|representations]] for how much they know about the system  (e.g. a person who designed part of a system then becomes a user of the whole system)

## Mental Model Research in HCI

- [[Mental Model Studies|HCI mental model research ]]focuses on the the contents of a user’s knowledge of a system
- Identifying how users acquire knowledge from a system, what a user should know, and how these affect learning and performance is important for [[Applications of Mental Models to Design|designing systems]] which are easy to use and learn
- There is also research in [[Shared Mental Models]] across groups
