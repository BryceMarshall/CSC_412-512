- Mental model of User Interface of Blind People
- Right to Left language User Interface
- Handedness and GUI Mental Model

**Note**

I want to look into the Right to Left language user’s mental model instead of interaction design in AR/VR.

## Mental model of blind users to assist designers in system development

- Understanding the mental model of blind users has been challenging.
- Existing mental models for the blind are configured by Kurniawan and Sutcliffe. In the study by Kurniawan et al, blind people have 3 strategies in dealing with a new environment.

- **Structural mental model**: one or two-dimensional array of icons of applications
- **Functional mental model**: created when each application in computers were associated with application (e.g. CTRL + M + W = Microsoft Words).
- **Hybrid mental model**: Combination of above two models

- For the blind people there are 3 stages in the mental model of system interaction

- **Exploration**: explore desktop, explore application, discover new features…
- **Task-action**: plan interaction, execute, change strategy…
- **Configuration**: configure/use

## Apple’s design documentation for Right to Left (RTL) languages

- Don’t reverse the order of numerals in a specific number. Even if the number appears in RTL language, keep numerals in a specific number left to right.

- Reverse the order of numerals that shows progress or counting direction

- People tend to view forward progress as moving in the same direction as the language they read.

- Flip interface icons but do not flip universal signs and marks.

## Universal Design Principles in Graphical User Interface: Understanding Visual Ergonomics for the Left-Handed Users in the Right-Handed World.

- People were introduced to computer mouse in their childhood. They use the mouse with their right hand since they are shown to do so and find others use it with their right hand.
- Left handed people are already accustomed to using the mouse with their non-dominant hand (right hand).
- Introducing left-handed people to use the mouse with their left hand introduced more inconvenience even if the mouse pointer is configured to be left-handed.

- Left handed populations’ graphical user interface mental model using a mouse has been solidified with using their non-dominant hand for their mouse.Perceptual impairmentsCognitive processesMotor impairments
