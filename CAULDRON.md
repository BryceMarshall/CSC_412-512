CAULDRON is a supporting tool for mental model elicitation and decision-making in user experience (UX) research, specifically designed to enhance Information Architecture (IA) development. Developed by [Martín & Macías (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2022.2041885) It utilizes [[Card Sorting]], a widely used UX research technique, to analyze how users categorize and relate information. CAULDRON integrates advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, such as K-Means Clustering and Decision Trees to display classification trends and category relationships.

The tool provides an interactive platform where UX researchers can collect, analyze, and refine information structures, enabling them to develop data-driven IA frameworks.

### Why CAULDRON Was Designed

The primary motivation behind CAULDRON was to address the limitations of traditional Card Sorting tools, which often rely on manual analysis and subjective interpretation. Many existing UX research methods lack quantitative validation and predictive capabilities, making it difficult for researchers to make informed decisions about IA structures. The authors designed CAULDRON to:

1. Improve the efficiency of Card Sorting analysis by automating statistical and clustering methods.
2. Enhance IA decision-making by providing researchers with quantifiable insights rather than relying on intuition.
3. Reduce inconsistencies in how UX professionals interpret user sorting behaviors.
4. Provide predictive modeling to explore how different user demographics influence categorization patterns.
5. Make IA research more scalable, allowing UX teams to analyze large participant datasets without extensive manual effort.

### Key Findings from CAULDRON

The study using CAULDRON provided several valuable insights:

1. Higher Data Accuracy – The tool's statistical techniques improved the reliability and consistency of IA evaluations, reducing subjective bias.
2. Enhanced User Categorization Analysis – Clustering methods revealed hidden relationships between concepts, helping designers build more intuitive navigation structures.
3. Decision Tree Findings – Predictive analytics showed that demographic factors (e.g., user expertise, familiarity with content) influenced how participants categorized information.
4. Increased UX Research Efficiency – Automating Card Sorting analysis significantly reduced the time and effort required to process large datasets.
5. Improved IA Validation – The tool provided evidence-based recommendations for refining IA, ensuring that navigation paths, menu structures, and labeling conventions aligned with user expectations.
