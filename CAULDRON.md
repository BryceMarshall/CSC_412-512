- Comprehensive Analysis User-centered Learning-based Decision-making Research On Navigation – tool that advances Card Sorting by integrating predictive analytics and advanced statistical analysis 

- Card Sorting is a UX research method used to show how users mentally organize and categorize information – like connectoins

1. Participants are given a set of "cards"

- Each card represents a piece of content, a feature, or a concept.
- eg: A researcher might provide a list of app names (e.g., _YouTube, Facebook, Google Drive_).

1. Users group the cards into categories

- Participants either use predefined categories or not

1. Researchers analyze how users group information

- The goal is to detect patterns in categorization, showa how users expect the content to be structured

CAULDRON automates the process by adding:

- Statistical analysis
- Predictive modeling (eg., Decision Trees to analyze participant behavior)
- Machine learning techniques 

Why do this? Help with decision making, ML techniques, improve “information architecture”

- Mental Model (main)

- focuses on how users conceptualize information and categorize elements based on their mental models.
- [[Card Sorting]] is used to uncover users’ mental models by analyzing how they classify different items.

- User Models

- indirectly addresses User Models by incorporating Decision Trees to analyze how different user characteristics (eg., experience, gender, time spent sorting) impact classification behavior.

- User Interface

- UX is a measure of how good UI is ?

- Evaluation of mental models

- Delphi method

- expert consensus technique used to gather opinions from a group of participants through multiple rounds of feedback: individual -> group -> rpt until stable

- Future work
